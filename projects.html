        <p>The objective of this virtual lab was to ensure accurate time synchronization across the network. Consistent timekeeping is crucial for accurate logging and effective troubleshooting, especially when analyzing events between multiple devices. Without synchronized clocks, correlating syslog entries or identifying the timing of incidents becomes unreliable and difficult.</p>

DHCP was set up for the 192.168.2.0/24 network, excluding 192.168.2.254 to reserve it as the default gateway. A point-to-point link between the routers used the 192.168.1.0/30 subnet, with .1 on Router-A and .2 on Router-B.</p>

SSH was configured on Router-A and Switch-B, with VLAN 40 and an SVI set up on Switch-B for management. A trunk link and ROAS were implemented to support VLAN traffic, and ACLs were added to both devices to restrict access.</p>

        <p>My objective in this at-home lab was to set up a simple network to have my (2) 2811 routers use OSPF to advertise their networks . I chose to use OSPF due to dynamic routing instead of setting up static routes. I started with an RFC 1918 address of 192.168.0.0/16 and did VLSM to simulate preserving as many addresses as possible.</p>

I created four VLANs across the first 16 switch ports and used ROAS on the router for inter-VLAN routing. ACLs were configured to allow only the Management VLAN (192.168.192.0) full access, while others were restricted, and additional virtual PCs were added to mirror a real-world environment.</p>
