I chose to use OSPF due to dynamic routing instead of setting up static routes. I started with an RFC 1918 address of 192.168.0.0/16 and did VLSM to simulate preserving as many addresses as possible.</p>

I created four VLANs across the first 16 switch ports and used ROAS on the router for inter-VLAN routing. ACLs were configured to allow only the Management VLAN (192.168.192.0) full access, while others were restricted, and additional virtual PCs were added to mirror a real-world environment.</p>
