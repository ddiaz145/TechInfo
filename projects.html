        <h3>Man-in-the-Midldle Attack</h3>
        <p>This lab demonstrates a DHCP starvation attack using Yersinia, followed by the deployment of a rogue DHCP server to intercept client traffic. By exhausting the IP address pool of the legitimate DHCP server and assigning malicious configurations, I gain control over network communications.</p>

          <h3>HSRP-STP</h3>
        <p>The objective of this virtual lab was to ensure accurate time synchronization across the network. Consistent timekeeping is crucial for accurate logging and effective troubleshooting, especially when analyzing events between multiple devices. Without synchronized clocks, correlating syslog entries or identifying the timing of incidents becomes unreliable and difficult.</p>

       <h3>DHCP</h3>
        <p>The objective of this at-home lab was to configure Router-A as a DHCP server and Router-B as a DHCP relay agent. DHCP was set up for the 192.168.2.0/24 network, excluding 192.168.2.254 to reserve it as the default gateway. A point-to-point link between the routers used the 192.168.1.0/30 subnet, with .1 on Router-A and .2 on Router-B.</p>

        <h3>SSH Connection</h3>
        <p>The goal of this at-home lab was to simulate SSH remote access similar to what’s used in data centers, enabling device management without relying on out-of-band ports. SSH was configured on Router-A and Switch-B, with VLAN 40 and an SVI set up on Switch-B for management. A trunk link and ROAS were implemented to support VLAN traffic, and ACLs were added to both devices to restrict access.</p>

        <h3>Simple OSPF Connection</h3>
        <p>My objective in this at-home lab was to set up a simple network to have my (2) 2811 routers use OSPF to advertise their networks . I chose to use OSPF due to dynamic routing instead of setting up static routes. I started with an RFC 1918 address of 192.168.0.0/16 and did VLSM to simulate preserving as many addresses as possible.</p>

        <h3>VLAN ROAS ACL</h3>
        <p>The objective of this at-home lab was to simulate a cost-effective workplace network using a Catalyst 2960 switch and a Cisco 2811 router. I created four VLANs across the first 16 switch ports and used ROAS on the router for inter-VLAN routing. ACLs were configured to allow only the Management VLAN (192.168.192.0) full access, while others were restricted, and additional virtual PCs were added to mirror a real-world environment.</p>

I used DHCP servers, ROAS with trunk links, and PAgP for redundancy and traffic optimization. ACLs were implemented to block Building-A from accessing printers in Building-B, ensuring only local access within Building-B.</p>

        <h3>Mega BGP Network</h3>

Alongside BGP, I implemented Inter-VLAN routing to reduce router traffic, and added DHCP, NTP, and SNMP servers to simulate real-world network services. Security measures, including usernames and passwords, were configured to enhance realism and reinforce best practices.</p>

Creating the topology provided a clearer understanding of how data travels across the network without needing to see the physical layout.</p>
